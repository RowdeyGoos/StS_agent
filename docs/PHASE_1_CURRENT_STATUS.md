# Phase 1 Current Integration Status

- **Status date:** 2026-08-31
- **Active bridge milestone:** `R0i`
- **Bridge version:** `0.8.0`
- **Protocol:** `live_probe_v0`
- **Pinned target:** Slay the Spire 2 `v0.107.1`, Steam build `23811903`,
  macOS arm64
- **Program disposition:** the project-owned bridge is the selected live path
  and has passed bounded live observation and control smokes; Phase 1 remains
  open and no full-run or near-optimal-agent claim has been made

This is the living status page for the full-game integration track. It records
what the current repository can do, what has actually been exercised in the
game, and what remains open. Exact requests, approvals, manifests, and
historical evidence reports remain preserved in their original documents; this
page supersedes their old point-in-time status statements without changing
their authorization scope.

## Current result

The repository now contains a functional, authenticated, project-owned live
bridge and external bounded controllers. Together they can:

- verify the pinned game build and classify the main menu and Settings screen;
- expose one public combat decision with advertised legal actions;
- apply snapshot-bound card-play and end-turn actions and reconcile the result;
- complete one turn or repeat the combat loop to an authoritative victory or
  defeat under a replaceable external decision provider;
- claim gold, open a card reward, choose an offered card, skip a skippable card
  reward, and proceed;
- expose currently travelable map destinations and select one advertised legal
  destination;
- represent bounded rest-site and safe standard-event choices; and
- compose combat, reward, map, and supported-room controllers into an external
  controller capped at three combat floors.

The bridge does not contain a learned model, search implementation, simulator,
or gameplay policy. Those remain host-side replaceable components behind the
same decision-provider seams.

## Milestone evidence

| Milestone | Capability added | Evidence disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `R0a` | Authenticated health, manifest, main-menu, and Settings reads | Bounded live smoke passed; normal teardown and clean base-game relaunch passed |
| `R0b` | One real read-only combat decision and host recommendation | Bounded live smoke passed; no game action was applied |
| `R0c` | One snapshot-bound combat action | Bounded live application and reconciliation passed |
| `R0d` | One complete combat turn through a replaceable provider | Bounded live turn completed |
| `R0e` | Repeat combat decisions until authoritative victory or defeat | Bounded live complete-combat loop passed |
| `R0f` | One reward decision followed by map arrival | Initial screen-transition timing blocked the first attempt; the narrowed retry passed reward and map checkpoints |
| `R0g` | Read and apply one legal map destination | Bounded live map observation and destination application passed |
| `R0h` | Compose combat victory, reward handling, and map travel into one floor | Bounded live floor transition reached the next room and clean teardown passed |
| `R0i` | Granular reward handling, supported room choices, and a capped multi-floor controller | Repository gates and fixtures passed; live smokes covered menu, Settings, combat, gold/card reward flows, card choose/skip, and map continuation. Full continuous three-floor live acceptance remains open |

Every completed campaign in this sequence ended with a normal game exit,
bridge quarantine/removal, a base-game main-menu relaunch with the listener
closed, and final cleanup while Steam Cloud was reported idle. The final base
projection again contained the expected `429` base files and no bridge overlay.
These results are bounded point observations, not proof that ordinary Steam or
game launches never touch profile, preference, save, or Cloud state.

## Evidence levels inside R0i

The current `R0i` source, contracts, tests, verifier, package, and disposable
fixture suites are complete for the declared bounded surface. Live evidence is
narrower:

- **Live demonstrated:** authenticated menu/Settings/combat reads; combat
  action and completion loops; gold and card-reward progression; card choice;
  card skip; legal map selection; one composed floor transition; and clean
  teardown/base relaunch.
- **Fixture demonstrated but not yet live accepted:** rest-site handling, safe
  standard-event handling, and a continuous controller covering the full
  three-combat-floor cap.
- **Observed residual:** one batched-controller attempt stopped on a transient
  `decision_response_mismatch`. The narrower combat controller subsequently
  resumed successfully, but the batched path needs a reproducible live pass or
  a minimized failure before it can be called stable.

## Current exclusions

The present bridge intentionally does not support:

- shops or purchases;
- potion acquisition, replacement, use, or discard decisions;
- custom, nested, dangerous, or otherwise unrecognized event interactions;
- full-map route planning;
- a complete autonomous run;
- in-process policy inference, model training, or search;
- profile, save, progress, history, preference, replay, seed, or multiplayer
  identity access;
- arbitrary filesystem access, outbound networking, Harmony patches, or hot
  unload; or
- unpinned game builds.

This means the project has a useful live integration substrate, not yet a
general Slay the Spire 2 environment and not yet an agent that can play a full
run near optimally.

## Open gates and next bounded target

Phase 1 remains open because the program still lacks a complete public
trajectory corpus, representative phase coverage, sustained reliability and
latency evidence, a selected fast-backend role, and a repeatable full-run
control path. The recoverable dedicated-profile baseline and its broader
passivity/rollback claims also remain unresolved; the approved live smokes
accepted a narrower ordinary-game-I/O risk instead of closing those gates.

The smallest useful next target is to stabilize the existing batched controller
and demonstrate one reproducible multi-floor live sequence using only already
implemented combat, reward, map, and supported-room contracts. That target
should:

1. minimize or explain `decision_response_mismatch` without adding privileged
   state;
2. obtain bounded live evidence for rest-site and standard-event handling when
   encountered;
3. preserve separate combat, reward, map, and room providers so components can
   still be compared independently;
4. finish with the existing quarantine, clean-base relaunch, and purge checks;
   and
5. avoid adding shops, models, search, or broader architecture until the
   existing slice is repeatable.

## Document map

- [`bridge/Sts2AgentBridge/README.md`](../bridge/Sts2AgentBridge/README.md)
  defines the current `R0i` implementation, commands, exact limits, package,
  and operational boundaries.
- [`research/PHASE_1_R0A_IMPLEMENTATION_EVIDENCE.md`](research/PHASE_1_R0A_IMPLEMENTATION_EVIDENCE.md)
  preserves the initial repository evidence and the detailed `R0a`/`R0b` live
  results.
- [`PHASE_1_R0A_LIVE_CAMPAIGN_REQUEST.md`](PHASE_1_R0A_LIVE_CAMPAIGN_REQUEST.md)
  preserves the exact first live-smoke authorization. It is a historical
  request, not standing authorization for another installation or launch.
- [`PHASE_1_RESTRICTED_BRIDGE_DESIGN.md`](PHASE_1_RESTRICTED_BRIDGE_DESIGN.md)
  and [`PHASE_1_BR0_PREFLIGHT.md`](PHASE_1_BR0_PREFLIGHT.md) preserve the
  original staged boundary and `R0a` freeze.
- [`PHASE_1_INTEGRATION_SPIKE.md`](PHASE_1_INTEGRATION_SPIKE.md) defines the
  broader evidence required to finish Phase 1 and choose the fast backend.
